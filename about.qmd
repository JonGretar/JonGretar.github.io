#### *Old dev and a forestry student focusing on forest biometrics.*

Born and raised in east of Iceland. From young age I was interested in computer work and ended up studying computer science. After leaving my studies, I worked for various companies in both software development capacity as well as system administration.

Seeking to broaden my horizons, I pursued a bachelor's degree in Forest Science in 2019. Throughout my studies, I specialized in statistical analysis, geographical information systems, and bio-metrics.  Now that I have completed my degree, I have relocated to Helsinki, Finland, to explore new and exciting opportunities.
