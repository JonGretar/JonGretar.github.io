From young age I was interested in computer work and ended up studying computer science. After leaving my studies, I worked for various companies in both software development capacity as well as system administration.\nSeeking to broaden my horizons, I pursued a bachelor’s degree in Forest Science in 2019. Throughout my studies, I specialized in statistical analysis, geographical information systems, and bio-metrics. Now that I have completed my degree, I have relocated to Helsinki, Finland, to explore new and exciting opportunities.\n\n\n\nTech Interests: Elixir, RStats, GIS, Statistics, SmartOS\nIn the beginning I was mostly in system management of Linux servers with software development as part of automation and integration of systems such as telcom switches until I moved to software development exclusively. Where I mostly worked with Ruby, Node.js, Erlang and Elixir.\nOther languages and software I have experience with is for example R, Python, MySQL, PostgreSQL, CouchDB, RethinkDB, SaltStack and Docker."

It would also be my entry into the world of using R for geographic data and an excellent use of the Deforestation(Ritchie and Roser 2021) dataset from TidyTuesday.\nThe trick to generating this kind of chart is to play around with the coordinate system. We need to transfer the bar generation into the latitude and the longitude of of the map.
